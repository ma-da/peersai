When the 500-page <a href=https://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/sscistudy1.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">executive summary</a> of the report was released more than a year ago, it prompted international outcry and renewed calls for prosecution.

But many of the most graphic details are in Volume III of the full report, which former Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein has <a href=\\\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/cia_torture_report_amr_5114322015.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">said</a> contains \\\"excruciating\\\" details on \\\"each of the 119 known individuals who were held in CIA custody.\\\" On the same day the executive summary was released, the Intelligence Committee sent copies of the full report to executive branch agencies with instructions ... that they be used \\\"as broadly as appropriate to make sure that this experience is never repeated.\\\" Last year, after succeeding Feinstein as chair, Sen.
